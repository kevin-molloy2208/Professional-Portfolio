Claymore
Big, filled with rage, attacks are sloppy, wields sword like a club. Brute force rather than percision

Alot of Claymore's Actions will be based on BOTW's two handed weapons and animations
Claymores Entrance will be something similar to one of link's taunts (ssbu)

Claymore's actions will be generally slower, big sword, shows weight. Follow through on the swings, blur on the swings.

Maybe a Kights Helmet? half of it gets broken

Might Change Weapon to Club
