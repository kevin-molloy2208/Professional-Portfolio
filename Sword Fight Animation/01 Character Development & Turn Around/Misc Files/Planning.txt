Final Animation Project
Two Characters, one with 2 handed sword one with daggers. Start of animation has "VS" screen like smash, like smash. Setting will be a flat plane, kind of like street fighter in concept but not really.

After the countdown they will run at eachother, Claymore will slam down, Daggers will slide under and behind C. C turns and does an up swing, D makes an X and blocks, swords get knocked away

Daggers will get knocked down, up against some form of wall or tree or something, and then cut to a dialouge box between the two. Work ut the words later but will end with something like "this is the end for yo-" Claymore gets cut off by a gunshot, cut back to main shot, slightly zoomed on the action, Daggers shoots him in the nuts. dialouge box will show up again but not as an isolated scene, Claymore " Interesting". Collapses. Daggers gets up and 
      does the cowboy gun spin thing? Dailouge box shows up again, "You nearly outsmarted me father, but I've yet to meet someone who can outsmart bullet" Fin 

Examine some of the metroid dread final fight scenes for camera angles
Faces will move like Henry Stickmin, in that the eyes and mouth will shift to the other side of the face. Seems like a pre-requisite but will probably forget
Storyboards are very zoomed out or something, for actual animation maybe zoom in a bit to give more room for potential facial expressions

Take the Tasteful sound effects from dig ed, there are some good "wooshes"
Do the text animations in dig ed
